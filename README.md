Processing large volume of data has always been a major problem due to the  increasing volume of  the  data. Batch processing can be applied in many use cases. Among them why not Pattern Matching for DNA Sequencing Data. In this project template, I am going to demonstrate batch processing using one of the projects of  Spring which is Spring Batch. Spring Batch provides functions for processing large volumes of data in batch jobs. In our case reading DNA file or database table and seeking for patterns I mean all the locationss of the specified pattern inside a DNA sequence.

DNA is a sequence of letters such as A, C, G, T. Searching for specific sequences is often difficult due to measurement errors, mutations or evolutionary alterations. Thus, similarity of two sequences using Levenshtein Distance is more useful than exact matches.

So instead of Karp Rabin you can use Levenshtein Distance or Jaro_Winkler_Similarity
